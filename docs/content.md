**Paragraph:**
More Than Cake aims to provide you with quality, home-baked goods. To us, delicious basics are the cornerstone to true bakeries. 
More than Cake started out as a quick project for French class in highschool. A simple idea for a bakery that aids the homeless is now on its way to becoming reality. All our products are hand-made with as many fresh, all-natural products as possible. 
It’s the little things that make the biggest difference.

## About Page
**Header**: our story

**Header 1**: Every town needs a go-to bakery...

**Paragraph**: 
...a multifunctional place where you can grab a muffin, spend an afternoon, or customize a birthday cake. We strive to be that place for you! Fluffy bakery provides home baked goods for your every need, with affordable customization options for decoration, flavors, and dietary restrictions. Getting what you want shouldn't cost extra. At Fluffy Bakery, our main goal is to give you a stress free personal experience. If it doesn't cost us extra, it won't cost you. 

Fluffy Bakery currently operates virtually through our website. In the future we hope to expand to a storefront location and give back to the community by partnering with local food banks and public kitchens. For now, please support our growth by placing orders 2 weeks before your need, and providing a delivery location!

Specializing in custom cakes, we've been a birthday staple in Philadelphia-area families since 2019. Various pastries, confections, and other baked treats cycle through our catalog, and we're always looking for new items to try! Food carries meaning, so we understand that your customer experience should be personal. That's why each of our items is carefully planned, executed, and packaged with the same love we grew up with. We're here for you, so choose us as your go-to!<br><br>
